Steps:
1. Changing the mongod.conf to initiate server with a replicaset named "replica"

2. Starting primary server at port 27017
	mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf

3.opening mongoshell
  	mongo --port 27017

4. Initiating replica set
	rs.initiate()

5. Starting other 2 servers at 27018 and 27019(open another instance of terminal)
	mongod --replSet replica --logpath "2.log" --dbpath rs2 --port 27018 
	mongod --replSet replica --logpath "3.log" --dbpath rs3 --port 27019  

6. Adding these two servers in the replica set
	rs.add("localhost:27018")
	rs.add("localhost:27019")

7. Checking the status of the servers
	rs.status() // Here all the ids and other info of the servers are shown

8. Changing the update time in one of the secondary servers by making it lag
	change = rs.conf()
	change.members[2].slaveDelay=3600;(1hr delay for the server at port 27109)
	rs.reconfig(change)

9. Optional
If we add delay to a server, then we generally would not want that server to be deemed
adequate to become a primary server because it would not contain the current state of the database. So we can set the priority to "0" in such case. Morover, if we want to prevent read as well we need to keep the server hidden. To do we we c hange the hidden parameter to true.

The commands can be changed as:
	change = rs.conf()
	change.members[2].priority=0;
	change.members[2].hidden=true;
	change.members[2].slaveDelay=3600;(1hr delay for the server at port 27109)
	rs.reconfig(change)
